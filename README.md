# MY NEOVIM CONFIG YESSSSIRRRRR

This is an updated config taken from my previous one [here](https://github.com/lycheeje11y/rb-dotfiles). You'll find that some of the code is the same.
I took a lot of inspiration from the neovim config found in
[this](https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files) repo (Go check out his youtube videos, they're great xD).
